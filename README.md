Here‚Äôs a refined version of your README that reflects your current setup, clarifies what‚Äôs mounted and persistent, and aligns with your modular, snapshot-free philosophy. I‚Äôve preserved your tone and structure while tightening clarity and consistency:

# üöÄ Automatic1111 in Docker (GPU‚Äëaccelerated)

This repo wraps [AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) in a reproducible Docker setup with GPU support.  
It‚Äôs designed for persistent use: your models, outputs, wildcards, and extensions live outside the container and are mounted in at runtime.

---

## üì¶ Requirements

- **Windows 11**: Docker Desktop with WSL2 backend and Ubuntu 22.04 installed
- **Linux**: Docker Engine with NVIDIA runtime

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Windows 11 Setup

1. **Install WSL2 with Ubuntu 22.04**  
   Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:  
   ```powershell
   wsl --install -d Ubuntu-22.04
   ```

2. **Install Docker Desktop**  
   Download from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and complete setup.

3. **Enable WSL Integration**  
   Docker Desktop ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Resources ‚Üí WSL Integration  
   Enable for your Ubuntu distro (`Ubuntu-22.04`)

4. **Open your WSL shell**  
   Press `Windows + S`, type `Ubuntu`, and launch the app.  
   You‚Äôll land in your Linux home (e.g., `/home/todd`)

5. **Run Docker commands inside WSL**  
   Always use the WSL shell to run:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

6. **(Optional) Install CUDA for other projects**  
   Not required for this container ‚Äî it includes its own CUDA runtime.  
   If you want CUDA in WSL for other tools:
   ```bash
   nvidia-smi
   ```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Setup

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tsondo/a1111-docker.git
   cd a1111-docker
   ```

2. Copy the environment template:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Edit `.env` to point to your local folders:
   ```env
   MODEL_DIR=/home/todd/a1111-docker/models
   OUTPUT_DIR=/home/todd/a1111-docker/output
   WILDCARD_DIR=/home/todd/a1111-docker/wildcards
   EXTENSIONS_DIR=/home/todd/a1111-docker/extensions
   CONFIG_DIR=/home/todd/a1111-docker/config
   ```

   These folders are mounted into the container at runtime.  
   You can use Windows-mounted paths (e.g., `/mnt/d/...`), but native WSL folders are faster.

4. Launch the container:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

## üñºÔ∏è Usage

- Open [http://localhost:7860](http://localhost:7860)
- Place `.safetensors` or `.ckpt` files into:
  ```
  <MODEL_DIR>/Stable-diffusion/
  ```
- Generated images will appear in:
  ```
  <OUTPUT_DIR>/
  ```
- Wildcards go in:
  ```
  <WILDCARD_DIR>/
  ```
- Extensions live in:
  ```
  <EXTENSIONS_DIR>/
  ```
- Optional config files:
  ```
  <CONFIG_DIR>/config.json
  <CONFIG_DIR>/ui-config.json
  ```

üß† Tip: Use subfolders like `sd1.5/`, `sdxl/`, and `lora/` to keep models organized by type.

---

## üì¶ Pre‚Äëinstalled Extensions

This image includes two baked-in extensions:

- **[ADetailer](https://github.com/Bing-su/adetailer)** ‚Äì automatic face/feature detection and inpainting
- **[Dynamic Prompts](https://github.com/adieyal/sd-dynamic-prompts)** ‚Äì wildcard-based prompt generation

All other extensions are mounted from your local `EXTENSIONS_DIR` and can be managed via the WebUI.

---

## üß™ Recommended Extensions

These are tested and compatible with this build:

- **[ControlNet](https://github.com/Mikubill/sd-webui-controlnet)**
- **[Civitai Helper](https://github.com/butaixianran/Stable-Diffusion-Webui-Civitai-Helper)**
- **[Rembg](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui-rembg)**
- **[Tag Autocomplete](https://github.com/DominikDoom/a1111-sd-webui-tagcomplete)**
- **[Prompt All‚Äëin‚ÄëOne](https://github.com/Physton/sd-webui-prompt-all-in-one)**
- **[Image Browser](https://github.com/yfszzx/stable-diffusion-webui-images-browser)**
- **[OpenPose Editor](https://github.com/fkunn1326/openpose-editor)**

---

## üéØ Philosophy

This image is designed for:

- **Utility**: Solves real creative and workflow needs
- **Stability**: Uses widely adopted, actively maintained extensions
- **Reproducibility**: Keeps the base image clean and predictable

Your models, outputs, wildcards, and extensions are all mounted ‚Äî nothing is baked into the container except the two core extensions. No snapshots required.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

- **Permission denied**: Ensure your folders exist and are writable
- **Models not detected**: Check they‚Äôre inside `Stable-diffusion/`
- **Slow I/O**: Avoid `/mnt/c/...` paths ‚Äî use native WSL folders for speed

---

## üë• Sharing

Anyone can use this setup by:

1. Installing Docker + WSL
2. Cloning the repo
3. Copying `.env.example` ‚Üí `.env`
4. Editing paths
5. Running:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

Tested on Windows 11 with Ubuntu 22.04 WSL, across multiple workstations with NVIDIA 4080 and 5090 GPUs.
